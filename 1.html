    <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>
    <p>Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties, composition, and behavior of matter. It is a fascinating field that explores the building blocks of the universe</p>
    <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>
    <p>The <mark>periodic table</mark> is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as Fe for iron, H for hydrogen,and O for oxygen. Elements are classified into groups and periods based on their properties.</p>
    <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>
    <p>Chemical reactions are represented using <i>chemical equations</i>. Here<sup>,</sup>s an example of a chemical reaction:</p>
    <eq>2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> &rarr; 2H<sub>2</sub>O</eq>
    <p>This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>) and oxygen gas (O<sub>2</sub>) to form water (H<sub>2</sub>O).</p>
    <h4>Important Concepts</h4>
    <p>Stoichiometry is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It invloves balancing chemical equations to ensure mass and charge are conserved.</p>
    <p><sub>Subscripts</sub>indicate the number of atoms of each element in a molecule, while <sup>superscripts</sup>represent charges or the number of atoms i an ion.</p>
    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
    <p>Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions that power our bodies,chemistry influences every aspect of our lives</p>
